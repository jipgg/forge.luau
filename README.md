In essence, plain luau with some baked in libraries for personal usage/automation. Nothing more, nothing less.

Main goal is to keep it a simple, single binary without too much other configuration logic/boilerplate and focus on portability from the get-go.

Far from being in a general usage state right now and mainly just having fun messing around with C++23 features that are supported on both GCC and MSVC already.
